Welcome to my portfolio, and thank you for taking the time to delve deeper into its contents. This portfolio represents the culmination of three and a half years of learning, immersing myself in the fundamentals of web development. I hope it serves as a showcase of my abilities, offers a glimpse into my personality, and fulfils some of your criteria as potential employers. <br /> <br />
The portfolio itself is the best expression to date of my skills as a developer, although it goes without saying that I am constantly learning. The projects therein are categorized into two main groups on the Projects page: Frontend and Backend. The frontend projects are earlier examples of my work, while the backend projects represent more recent endeavours. The general trajectory of the projects can be seen in the increasing encapsulation of frontend code from static files to templates to components with the eventual backend accoutrements. My approach to learning was to use Udemy’s Web Developer Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) as a template, a direction of travel if you like, but most of the learning was accomplished by getting my hands dirty and building projects. <br /> <br />
Once the initial build of these projects was completed, they were largely left untouched, save for necessary refactoring to enable their deployment on Heroku or to address any glaring issues in styling or user experience. My rationale for this approach was twofold. Firstly, I wanted my projects to serve as a testament to my learning journey. Secondly, I recognized that testing my skills in the job market and securing employment would be more conducive to advancing my coding abilities than spending additional time solely on refactoring. At the very least, I believe they demonstrate my competence at a junior level. <br /> <br />
The aim of my first substantial project, MarathonRookie, was to rebuild a website whose content I admired (http://www.marathonrookie.com/marathon-training.html) with the styles of a web site I appreciated stylistically. Unfortunately, I no longer have the reference to the site that inspired my styling choices, save to say that it was a web development company based in Preston, Lancashire. This project primarily focused on familiarizing myself with Bootstrap and incorporating a touch of JavaScript. <br /> <br />
CoinTracker, my subsequent project, was my first significant foray into JavaScript and stemmed from a passing interest in cryptocurrencies (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn). It was during this time that I encountered the JavaScript fetch API which amazed me with its ability to retrieve data from various web endpoints. Therefore, the primary goals of CoinTracker were to utilize fetch requests, work with JSON data, and explore the wider uses of JavaScript with the assistance of Chart.JS. <br /> <br /> 
As a long time Heavy Metal fan, the idea of FallenHeroesOfMetal was to create a fan site based around, you’ve guessed it, the fallen heroes of Metal. This initially started out as a frontend project but because I liked the way it turned out I decided to embellish it with a forum and the associated backend features for processing user information and user articles. It is worth pointing out however, that the Merch Store is a dummy, not least because there isn’t any merch but also due to security concerns regarding credit card payments. Many of the links to social media and so on are also dummies and serve only to simulate professional sites in production. That said, the contact pages of both LeMotJuste and the portfolio itself are up and running so feel free to say ‘hi’!  <br /> <br />
LeMotJuste emerged from my desire to create a database for a collection of quotes I accumulated over the years. These quotes provided the data for the Quote Generator. Building upon this idea I drew inspiration from my time at university and experience with EndNote ( https://endnote.com/ ).  I envisioned creating my own version of an Endnote-like application that could effectively manage my quote collection. Create an account with LMJ and add your own quotes! <br /> <br />
Thanks for stopping by. <br /> <br />
Mick.
